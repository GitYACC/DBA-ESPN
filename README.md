## üìù Background

Started off as a silly idea to "league-ify" our friend group's basketball games. Soon, it caught on to a lot of the players across the city. We ended up having 50+ active players, and another 50+ substitute players that would play whenever they had the time to. I created the website to keep track of players, stats and games. It included an admin panel for referees to manage updating stats.

## üìà Home Page

Home page shows active chart toppers in different stats, as well as team trades, and other announcments (including the sign in page too)

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Players

Built a dynamic combobox to keep track of new players, and old, existing ones.

## üîê Admin Panel

Admin panel with full access to data stored in the database. Allowed CRUD operations to the backend API to update and upkeep different data.
